NFM Parameter ranking
=====================

Random forest approach to ranking parameter importance in a neural field model, adapted from Ferrat
et al.Â 2018 [0].

This is a project that I worked on in 2018 during my time between University of Exeter and
University of Birmingham. The initial version of this project was a random collection of scripts
that generated a parameter space in MATLAB, solved equations in Julia, and implemented the random
forest in R.

Revisiting this in 2024, I'm aiming to write this in pure Julia with a clearer project structure
